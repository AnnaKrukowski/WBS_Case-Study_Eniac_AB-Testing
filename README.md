#Eniac A/B Testing Project

##Overview
This project aims to increase Eniac's revenue by optimizing the conversion rate of the "SHOP NOW" button on the website's landing page. An A/B test was conducted to evaluate different versions of the button, focusing on the Click-Through Rate (CTR).

##Project Objectives
Evaluate the impact of different "SHOP NOW" button designs on user conversions.
Determine which button version results in the highest CTR.

- Version A: Original white "SHOP NOW" button.
- Version B: Red "SHOP NOW" button.
- Version C: White "SEE DEALS" button.
- Version D: Red "SEE DEALS" button.
